## ✨ Why GeminiDesk?

GeminiDesk isn't just a web wrapper; it's a carefully crafted desktop experience designed to make you more efficient. It elevates Google Gemini from a browser tab into a powerful, native desktop application.

* **📌 Always-On-Top Mode**: Keep Gemini visible over all your other windows. Perfect for referencing, coding, or multitasking without losing context.

* **⚡ Instant Access with Global Hotkeys**: Summon or dismiss GeminiDesk instantly from anywhere on your computer.
    * **`Ctrl + G`**: Toggle the app's visibility. It's there when you need it, gone when you don't.
    * **`Ctrl + Q`**: Instantly and completely close the application.

* **🎨 Clean & Minimalist UI**: A beautiful, borderless design with a custom draggable header puts the focus squarely on the AI conversation, eliminating browser clutter.

* **🔒 Persistent Login**: Sign in to your Google account once, and GeminiDesk keeps you logged in across sessions. No more repetitive logins.

* **🚀 Launch on Startup**: During installation, you can choose to have GeminiDesk launch automatically when your computer starts, so it's always ready for you.

* **💼 Lightweight & Focused**: Enjoy a dedicated environment for Gemini without the memory and CPU overhead of a full web browser with countless open tabs.
