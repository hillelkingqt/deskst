### ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note for macOS Heroes ‚ö†Ô∏è

Due to Apple's Gatekeeper security, apps not signed with a pricey Apple Developer ID get marked as "quarantined" when downloaded. This can cause a scary (but false) error message: ‚ÄúGeminiDesk is damaged and can‚Äôt be opened.‚Äù

**Fear not! Here‚Äôs the simple spell to fix it:**

1.  After installing, **do not launch the app yet**.
2.  Open your `Terminal` app (you can find it via Spotlight search).
3.  Paste and run this command. It removes the quarantine flag, telling macOS to trust the app:
    ```sh
    xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/GeminiDesk.app
    ```
4.  Now, launch the app normally from Launchpad or your Applications folder.

This one-time step is all it takes to get the best Gemini desktop app running smoothly on your Mac.
